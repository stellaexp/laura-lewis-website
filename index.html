                <p>The cosmetic element of facial acupuncture involves the insertion of ultra-thin needles in the face.  
                    These needles stimulate the cells that initiate skin repair and collagen replenishment, as well as increasing blood circulation to the face and relaxing some of the facial muscles.

                <p>In addition to this beauty-focused treatment, additional points may be used to re-address any imbalances with the inner body systems, such as issues with sleep, anxiety or digestion.

                <p>
                    Acupuncture is an ancient system of healing.  The principle of this natural medicine is to restore balance, when a person’s energy or Qi, pronounced Chi, is out of balance.  
                    In good physical and emotional health, it flows freely.  However, Qi can become stuck, become deficient or in excess, in which case the Qi is no longer balanced.  Qi is the substance that underpins this medicine in the body.  
                    Qi can be explained as the energetic, electrical force that flows around the body.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This system of healing involves working with acupuncture “channels,” which are part of a larger network, that flow all over the body and to 12 different organs, for example the Heart.  
                    Acupuncture points run along these channels, where fine needles are placed.  The points on these channels are where the Qi accumulates.
               </p>
               <p>
                    Feeling the pulse, looking at the tongue and listening closely to what a patient says will indicate what is going on energetically in their body.  
                    With this information, different acupuncture points will be chosen and needled on the body, making every treatment different for each person.

            <h3 class="mb-3 bold">HOW IT ALL WORKS</h3>
                <p>
                    Acupuncture looks at each person differently and therefore each treatment is personalised.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I combine Traditional Chinese Medicine Acupuncture with Five Element Acupuncture after studying for 4 years at the renowned College of Integrated Chinese Medicine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my sessions, I make space for the belief that the emotions can manifest themselves physically.  I work with the emotional body and the physical body, always trying to address the root of the problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I feel that both Eastern and Western medicine are powerful in their own way, and I see that there is space for my acupuncture to be used as a tool on its own, as a holistic natural medicine or in combination with other Western therapies and medicines.  
                    If it’s necessary, during a session I may also be hands on and use some Cupping, Moxa &#38 Gua-sha.

            <h3 class="mb-3 bold">HOW TO GET IN TOUCH</h3>
                <p>
                    I currently work from my home in West London.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A session will last an hour, unless it is the first time we have met, which will then take over an hour as a detailed history will be taken in order to make a precise diagnosis. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following that, a typical session will last an hour, which is a great length of time to really unwind and to get those needles to work.  It’s rare these days that you get an hour out of life to simply focus on just you. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Depending on the reason for treatment, it will depend on whether it will be advised to come weekly or monthly or once in a blue moon.
                </p>
