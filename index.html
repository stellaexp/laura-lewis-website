                Acupuncture is an ancient system of healing. The principle of this natural medicine is to restore
                    balance.
                    Qi, pronounced Chi, is the substance that underpins this medicine in the body. Qi can be explained
                    as the
                    energetic, electrical force that flows around the body. In good physical and emotional health, it
                    flows freely. However, Qi can become stuck, become deficient or in excess, in which case the Qi is
                    no longer balanced.

            <h3 class="mb-3">HOW?</h3>
                <p>This system of healing involves working with acupuncture “channels,” which are part of a larger
                    network, that flow
                    all over the body and to 12 different organs, for example the Heart. Acupuncture points run along
                    these channels, where fine needles are placed.
                    The points on these channels are where the Qi accumulates.</p>
                <p>A skilled acupuncturist will be able to feel the pulse, look at the tongue and listen closely to
                    what a patient says in order to understand what is going on energetically in their body. With this
                    information, a
                    practitioner will decide which acupuncture points to needle, making every treatment different
                    for each person.</p>
                <p>In addition to needling acupuncture points, non acupuncture points can be needled on the body. Commonly, 
                    a needle can be used here to disperse muscle knots, relieve tension or to help with other muscular skeletal 
                    conditions.</p>

            <h3 class="mb-3">WHY ME?</h3>
                <p>Acupuncture looks at each person differently and therefore in my sessions, each treatment is
                    personalised. I combine Traditional Chinese Medicine Acupuncture with Five Element Acupuncture after
                    studying for 4 years at the renowned College of Integrated Chinese Medicine.</p>
                <p>In my sessions, I make space for the belief that the emotions can manifest themselves physically.
                    I will take a detailed history from each patient because I like to work from the ground up, trying
                    to address the root of the problem.
                    For me, I feel that both Eastern and Western medicine are powerful in their own way, and I see that
                    there is space for my acupuncture to be used as a tool on its own, but also in combination with
                    other Western therapies or medicines.</p>
                <p>If it’s necessary, during a session I may also use Cupping therapy, Moxa and Gua-sha.
                    Sessions will last an hour, so what I will be able to give you is my undivided time and my energy.

            <h3 class="mb-3">FIVE ELEMENT ACUPUNCTURE</h3>
                <p>Five Element Acupuncture is a style of acupuncture which categorises a person into one of the five
                    elements in the natural world; water, wood, fire, earth & metal.
                    These natural elements correspond to the seasons that become and change from one to the next in the
                    natural world. The ancient Chinese observed that humans are a microcosm of this natural world.
                    Each element has different qualities and each element is linked with a yin and a yang organ in the
                    body, for example a person who has qualities of the water element, has an energetic connection to
                    the bladder (yang) and kidneys (yin).
                    Human beings have all 5 elements within them, but the Five Element theory is that each individual
                    human has a master element. And by making contact with this element and the organs that are
                    connected to this element through acupuncture and acupressure, balance can be restored.

                                A session will last an hour, unless it is the first time we have met, which will then take over an
                                hour as a detailed
                                history will be taken in order to make a precise diagnosis.</p>
